Control-System-Analysis-and-Identification-with-MATLAB

This is a MATLAB package that provides a set of tools for analyzing and identifying control systems. The package includes functions for designing and analyzing feedback control systems, as well as tools for identifying the parameters of unknown systems based on input-output data.

Features
Feedback control system design using classical and modern techniques, including root locus, Bode plots, Nyquist plots, and pole placement.
System identification using various methods, including least squares, recursive least squares, and the Kalman filter.
Model order reduction techniques, such as balanced truncation and singular value decomposition.
Visualization tools for analyzing system performance, including time-domain and frequency-domain plots.
Usage
To use this package, simply clone the repository to your local machine and add the package directory to your MATLAB path. The package includes a set of example scripts that demonstrate the use of the various functions and tools.

Requirements
This package requires MATLAB and the Control System Toolbox.
